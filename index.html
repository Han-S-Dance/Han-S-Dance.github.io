<p>Hi,</p> 

<p>Iâ€™m Han, a recent graduate of the MSc Computer Animation & Visual Effects course at Bournemouth University. 
A couple of years ago I created a ray tracer in MatLab. This opened up the world of 3D computer graphics to me, which I have been exploring ever since, and subsequently led me to undertake the course at Bournemouth. </p> 

<p>My main interests now include creating procedural simulations, effects, tools for artists and virtual garments, 
typically in: Houdini, Marvellous Designer, Unreal Engine and Maya. 
I have a background in mathematics (holding a BSc Mathematical Sciences from The University of Bath) 
which helps with the technical and coding side.</p>

Feel free to look at my portfolio of work and contact me via LinkedIn to discuss anything.
