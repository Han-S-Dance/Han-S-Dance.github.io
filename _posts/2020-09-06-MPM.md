Custom Material Point Method (MPM) solver created from scratch in Houdini. Using the Multiple Solver and Gas Microsolvers in the DOP network. Created for my Masters Project at Bournemouth University, I looked to implement the paper : A material point method for snow simulation (Stomakhin et al. 2013). 

MPM is a custom hybrid particle grid method that consists of 10 steps. Each of these steps have been implemented on particle geometry using Gas Microsolvers, most notably the Gas Field Wrangle node, where voxel values can be changed through VEX snippets. A high level overview of the DOP network can be seen below.

The video below shows the solver in action, with both simple and complex forces.
