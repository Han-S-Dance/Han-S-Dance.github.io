An artist friendly geometry level Houdini Digital Asset (HDA) that can quickly configure a simple garden.


This project was undertaken for the CGI Tools unit of the MSc Computer Animation & Visual Effects course at Bournemouth University. This was an introduction to Houdini and creating user friendly tools within the software. The garden consists of 5 base primitive geometries all modeled in Houdini, these base geometries can be swapped out for more complex geometry.

* Turf colour
* Path colour
* Plant distribution
