An investigation into creating virtual garments in Houdini and Marvelous Designer, focusing on tailoring and cut. This project was undertaken as part of the Personal Inquiry unit of the MSc Computer Animation & Visual Effects course at Bournemouth University. 
 
I created multiple garments in both MD & Houdini. During this process I investigated:
* How to change fabric material properties to mimic different real fabrics, and how this impacts the garments movement during simulation.
* Modelling and adjusting the 2D patterns to fit the garments to the characters body.
* How to harness elastic seams and other specialist tools, in such a manner the fabric behaves and moves differently. 

The video below shows some of the created garments in movement.
